      <h3><a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>
      <p>My name is Samuel Alebachew, a computer engineer with interests spanning over distant subjects from beer, outdoor activities, people/relationships, all STEM fields and especially (obviously) computer science. This page is where I get to show people what I don't know, what I think I know, and what I have done with what I think I know. Surprisingly, you can do a lot with just that much. This page is very new and I will be making several changes quite often. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
