      <h3><a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Projects...</h3>
      <p>Here lie a select few of the projects I have been involved in. Most of these projects if not all of them are computer science/engineering related. Some projects are small ones that I have been working for just a few weeks while others are months worth. </p>

    <ul class="rig">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
            {% if post.type == 'project' %}
        <li>
          <a href="{{ post.url }}">
            <img src="{{ post.imageUrl }}" />
            <h3>{{ post.title }}</h3>
          </a>
          <p>{{ post.description }}</p>
        </li>
      {% endif %}
