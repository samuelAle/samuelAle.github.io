For a long time, I wanted to make my own website. I wanted to have a section of the internet that was all about me and the things I am passionate about. Social media didn't feel personal enough and there wasn't enough space in Facebook's datacenter for my ego (jk). Even as a software developer in a steady job, there were several things in the way of having a decent website:

- Advanced knowledge of html/css/javascript. My knowledge was limited to a single intro to web development class.
- The fact that I am frugal and don't want to pay for hosting services or tools like WordPress
- I didn't have much time to learn how to host and develop my own site from scratch

Eventually I came across a solution that would provide me with free hosting and quick development that only required me to learn some new tech. That solution was to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) alongside [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The way it works is, first you purchase a domain name from a registrar of your choice. I bought mine (samuelale.com) from [NameCheap](www.namecheap.com). Once you have your own domain, make a github account and follow the tutorials/instructions provided on their github pages section. I was able to follow the instruction there and use the documentation from Jekyll to develop the first iteration of this website at no monthly cost!
