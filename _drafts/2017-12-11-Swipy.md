Swipy
==============

Swipy &copy; is a tool which may be attached to an e-reader and swipe pages left and right via remote control. Customers would be able to read their favorite books in any position without moving a muscle. It has been a common struggle for people to find the "_sweet spot_" while reading in bed or on the couch. One hand must awkwardly remain extended in order to hold the e-reader and turn pages. 

Swipy provides the following benefits:
* Compliments e-reader stands and similar attachements.
* Prevents poor posture by allowing customers to place the e-reader in a higher position that would otherwise be too cumbersome if holding it with their hands.
* Allows customers to read in their most comfortable positions in bed. Even allowing them to fall asleep in such positions.
* Can also be used for tablets of any size.

## Prototyping

#### Tenets

1. Swipy must support various sizes of tablets and their bezel sizes.
2. It must be as proportionally small / lightweight as today's best e-readers.
3. It should not require a charge and batteries should last at least 6 months
4. Remote should be accurate. One-click every time
5. It must be easy to use.

#### Parts

Here are the parts I will be using to build a prototype.

* [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno/](Arduino Uno)
* [https://tinyurl.com/yanz3a43](Capactive Pen)
* [https://tinyurl.com/yddp5gla](Continuous Rotation Servo)
* IR Receiver & Transmitter
* Test Tablet / E-reader
