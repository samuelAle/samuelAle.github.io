The software hosted here publicly, when configured to a\nTurtleBot using the robotics framework <a href=\"http://wiki.ros.org/\">ROS</a>, will transform the\nTurtleBot into a sophisticated TrayBot. A TrayBot can perform the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate through a room while avoiding non-human obstacles in its path</li>\n<li>Detect people using leg-recognition software via a Microsoft Kinect</li>\n<li>Approach people safely, and efficiently to serve them refreshments or whatever you might like to serve.</li>\n<li>Tell pre-programmed jokes as it moves from guest to guest.</li>\n<li>Navigate back to a pre-defined refill station when it has run out of refreshments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The TrayBot is fully autonomous, yet can be controlled via a web-app interface if desired.\nThe web interface shows a map of the area the TrayBot is using to navigate and serve guests.\nAn operator could manually force the TrayBot to return to a refill station,\nor manually point out a location for the TrayBot to navigate to.\nThe operator can even drive the TrayBot using the web controls too.\nSome things we would like to add is support for multiple TrayBots in the same location, and\nhaving configureable settings for the user to be able to define their own jokes and easily\nredefine the TrayBot's internal map of the area its in.</p>\n<h5>Click for a short presentation of a functional TrayBot</h5>\n<iframe alt=\"TrayBot Presentation\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKJAJsvxj6k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>TurtleBot</li>\n<li>Kinect</li>\n<li>Flat bottom tray</li>\n<li>Staples usb scale</li>\n<li>Unix OS configured with ROS</li>\n<li>(Optional) TurtleBot extension stand</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Autumn 2014 Robotics Capstone</h2>\n<p>This software was developed for a senior capstone course held at the\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle.
