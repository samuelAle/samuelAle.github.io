I wanted to have a section of the internet that was all about me and the things I am passionate about. Social media didn't feel personal enough and there wasn't enough space in Facebook's datacenter for my ego (jk). Even as a software developer in a steady job, there were several things in the way of having a decent website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced knowledge of html/css/javascript. My knowledge was limited to a single intro to web development class.</li>\n<li>The fact that I am frugal and don't want to pay for hosting services or tools like WordPress</li>\n<li>I didn't have much time to learn how to host and develop my own site from scratch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually I came across a solution that would provide me with free hosting and quick development that only required me to learn some new tech. That solution was to use <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> alongside <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a>.</p>\n<p>The way it works is, first you purchase a domain name from a registrar of your choice. I bought mine (samuelale.com) from <a href=\"www.namecheap.com\">NameCheap</a>. Once you have your own domain, make a github account and follow the tutorials/instructions provided on their github pages section. I was able to follow the instruction there and use the documentation from Jekyll to develop the first iteration of this website at no monthly cost!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Free Blogging; with Jekyll and Gatsby","date":"20 April, 2016","tags":["Blog","Jekyll"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/content/website/"}}}
